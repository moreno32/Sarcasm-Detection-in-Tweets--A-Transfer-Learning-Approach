Title: "Sarcasm Detection in Tweets: A Transfer Learning Approach"

Overview:
In this project, you will use transfer learning and build a sarcasm classifier for tweets using the Sentiment140 dataset and GloVe embeddings. You will use python, tensorflow, csv, random, and numpy to preprocess and clean the data, tokenize the tweets, and train a machine learning model to classify tweets as sarcastic or not. You will also visualize the performance of the model and evaluate its accuracy.

Motivation:
Sarcasm is a form of irony that is often used in social media. It can be challenging to detect sarcasm in text, especially in short, informal messages like tweets. In this project, you will explore a transfer learning approach to sarcasm classification, using pre-trained GloVe embeddings to improve the performance of the model. By working with a large dataset of tweets, you will aim to reduce the risk of overfitting and produce a classifier with high accuracy.

Learning Objectives:

Clean and preprocess large text datasets
Implement transfer learning for text classification
Use GloVe embeddings to improve the performance of a text classifier
Train and evaluate a machine learning model for sarcasm detection in tweets

Technical Aspect:
The technical aspect of this project involves preprocessing and cleansing the Sentiment140 dataset, tokenizing the tweets, and using the GloVe embeddings to improve the performance of the sarcasm classifier. You will use python, tensorflow, csv, random, and numpy to implement the project.
